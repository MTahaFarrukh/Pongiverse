Pongiverse is a multi-mode game project developed with the inspiration from the 
game “Pong”. It has the graphics and mechanics of Pong but with three modes: 
1. Tennis 
2. Table-Tennis 
3. Air Hockey 
Each of these modes offer a similar gaming concept, but have different layouts and 
different sounds. The focus on the idea of this development was to develop a 
simple user-friendly gameplay, background music, textures & sound effects. The 
development involved setting up core features like paddles and ball with their 
mechanics, logics of the scoreboard & a home screen for all the modes. The game 
was developed using Raylib library in C.
